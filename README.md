# First-program
I'm beginning to learn how to program and did something on Scratch after some tutorials.
I think I can't call this project a proper "game", but I don't have a better name, so: This is a "game" I created on Scratch... Actually, this is my first interaction with programming.
The game is about a cat that wants to eat pizzas... Yeah, that's all.
